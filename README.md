# Ancient Secrets of Computer Vision  

This repository documents my work from **Joseph Redmon‚Äôs *Ancient Secrets of Computer Vision*** course. The course dives deep into the foundations of computer vision, reconstructing many of the classic algorithms that shaped the field before the deep learning era.

## üìö Course & Learning Focus  
The goal of this work was not just to use libraries, but to **rebuild key algorithms from first principles**, gaining intuition for both their mathematical foundations and practical applications. Topics explored include:  

- Image representation and color spaces  
- Convolution and filtering (Gaussian, Sobel, Laplacian, etc.)  
- Edge and corner detection (Canny, Harris)  
- Feature extraction and descriptors (SIFT-like methods)  
- Geometric transformations, homographies, and image alignment  
- Image pyramids and multi-scale analysis  
- Classic object detection pipelines and their evolution
- Connections between classical methods and **modern machine learning approaches**

## üéØ Purpose of This Repository  
- **Algorithmic Practice**: All major algorithms were **implemented and tested** in Python/PyTorch/NumPy/OpenCV.  
- **Research-Oriented Understanding**: Emphasis on *why* these methods work, their limitations, and their role in modern computer vision.  
- **Experimentation**: Includes notebooks, experiments, and visualizations of algorithm outputs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Scikit-learn** (for basic ML models and comparisons)  
- **NumPy**   
- **OpenCV**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

## üîë Key Takeaways  
- Practicing algorithms provided a **deeper theoretical grounding** beyond black-box library use.  
- Many ‚Äúancient‚Äù methods remain **highly relevant** in research, either as preprocessing steps or as conceptual building blocks for modern deep learning approaches.  
- Reinforced the importance of **mathematical intuition** (linear algebra, calculus, probability) in designing and analyzing vision systems.  
- Strengthened ability to **connect classical CV algorithms with modern architectures** like CNNs and Vision Transformers, seeing how past ideas influenced present breakthroughs.  
- Gained confidence in **debugging and verifying algorithm behavior** through visualization and careful comparison with established implementations.

## üìå Status  
This repo represents a completed run of the course, though I plan to expand with:  
- Comparisons between classical algorithms and deep learning approaches  
- Notes connecting ‚Äúancient‚Äù methods to modern architectures in computer vision
